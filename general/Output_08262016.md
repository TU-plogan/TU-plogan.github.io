## eb03

Text appears clean overall. Output uses <p> containers for virtually everything.
long-s needs converting to short-s. 

Includes invalid “name” attribution: ``<a name="caption1"></a><h2>`` sporadically

I think it still includes some of the first-word identifiers from the previous page, so same word is occurring twice.

## eb07

Excessive longline warning in Oxygen

Only 96 <p> elements. Inconsistent: sometimes enclose only a portion of an article, beginning in mid-sentence. (see l. 47)
Faulty character entity recognition for single, double quotes, apostrophes (inconsistent)
Text looks clean. Article titles preceded by <br> and capitalized.
Continuity. See ll. 61-67. There’s footnotes here, but I don’t see the correct path.

## eb09

Excessive longlines and bi-directional character warnings in Oxygen
Text begins in the middle of article on RABAD, rather than at the beginning of R. Check the original image files for eb09 to see where they begin.
Very few <p> elements--only 30 for entire document. View in browser shows a clear division into articles, though, with format: <br>TITLE.
Added extra line b/w paragraphs.

Problem lines 55-57, with excessive <br> and formatting codes for nearly every letter.
A few character entity recognition problems

## eb11

Excessive longlines and bi-directional character warnings in Oxygen (for Hebrew text)
Text appears to be based on uncorrected OCR output, with many errors.
Multiple long sections of unreadable text, with spaces between every letter.
End of line hyphen problem, such as: “engage-<br/>ment”
See notes on eb11 full-text editions available online and consider using them for comparison, to clean our text.
