# EB Filenaming Conventions

All filenames for encyclopedia content use the following pattern:

**eb*ee-vv-a-pppp\_ss*.xml**

| variable | value |
|:---- |:---- |
| *ee* | edition |
| *vv* | volume |
| *a* | entry letter |
| *pppp* | page number |
| *ss* | page sequence number |

Filenames begin with *eb* to indicate they are from the *Encyclopedia Britannica*. That is followed by a series of variables. The number of digits for each variable is always the same (thus, for page numbers, 1 is `0001`).

*Examples:* 

<dl>
<dt>eb09-20-r-0402_02.xml</dt>  
<dd>The second entry on page 402 under the letter "R" in volume 20 of the 9th edition.</dd> 

<dt>eb11-23-r-0022_03.xml</dt>  
<dd>The third entry on page 22 under the letter "R" in volume 23 of the 11th edition.</dd>
