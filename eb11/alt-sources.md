# eb11: Alternate Full-Text Sources 

[Return to menu](../README.md)

## Introduction

eb11 is the most frequently transcribed edition and is available online in several places. These are notes on the different sources and the results of comparing them to our existing text file. The comparison is done using WinMerge 2.14. Prior to the comparison, I removed line-endings from my sample of entries, but kept paragraphs. Also changed all double- to single-spaces. 

The letter “R” is eb11, vol 22:765-976, and vol 23:1-38.

Full text done with hand transcription. Entries are done individually,rather than pages or letters. “R” is incomplete, with <50% transcribed.

### Theodora

Text is in html form with one file per entry. There is no download affordance, so I used cut and paste. It is reasonably clean, but the editors have changed the entry names for persons to fn-ln, instead of eb’s format of ln-fn. So I wonder what else they have changed? Comparison with our OCR suggests it is similar in accuracy rate but has different errors. It makes proofreading extremely easy in WinMerge, though I also noticed some places where they had the same error we did, which WinMerge will not catch.

IA has djvu text, but it will display full volumes in a single plain-text format that can be cut and pasted into a text file. This is dirty OCR, done mechanically in 2011 and uncorrected. It includes pages numbers and running heads, making it difficult to work with. In WinMerge, their text was perhaps slightly less accurate than ours, but their errors are different from ours, making it useful for proofreading through comparison, like Theodora.

### Project Guttenberg

PG is transcribing all of eb11 but it is not done yet. They are moving sequentially through the volumes and are currently up to "M," so “R” is not yet available.

### Online Encyclopedia

[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/](http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/)

Claims to have complete text of eb11. Each entry is on a separate page. They’re mixed in with other material. Could be useful for text of individual articles to compare, but it lets user “edit” the articles, so ....
